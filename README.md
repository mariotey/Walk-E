# BN4101: Walking Buddy for Prehabilitation #
Ongoing Project

## Description ##
Prehabilitative exercises have been proven to enhance surgical outcomes and recovery rates, particularly in elderly patients. However, to ensure the effectiveness of these exercises, gait analysis is essential in identifying any gait abnormalities or deficiencies that may be contributing to a patient's physical limitations, especially for those who are scheduled for lower limb surgeries. By analyzing a patient's gait parameters, such as cadence, stride length, and speed, doctors can gain insight into their walking patterns, which can aid in developing personalized treatment plans and monitoring progress.

Unfortunately, conventional gait analysis methods are often laborious, time-consuming, and uncomfortable for patients. They require a patient to travel to a specialized laboratory and be outfitted with a variety of sensors and markers on their body. As a result, many elderly patients may not have access to these services or may be reluctant to undergo them.

To address these challenges, the development of a wheeled robot equipped with gait analysis capability is proposed. The robot provides a convenient and accessible solution that can be used in a clinical setting without the need for extensive setup or specialized equipment and will be marketed towards healthcare service providers. With the robot, patients will be led around a curated route while their lower limb joint range-of-motion and walking performance are being monitored, allowing for real-time gait analysis readings. These readings will be useful for doctors in making more accurate diagnoses, developing tailored treatment plans, and tracking patients' recovery progress. Additionally, the robotâ€™s nature of being easily deployable and accessible allows for faster retrieval of gait analytics compared to conventional gait analysis methods, enabling doctors to make quicker decisions about diagnosis, treatment planning, prehabilitation, and postoperative monitoring. The expedited process benefits not only the patients by providing more timely and accurate care but also healthcare providers by improving efficiency and reducing costs.

In conclusion, this project aims to address the challenges encountered with conventional gait analysis methods and offer a cost-effective and easily deployable solution. The proposed robot can expedite the gait evaluation process and enable healthcare providers to make quicker decisions to tailor programs that better suit patients' needs. This could benefit patients and healthcare providers by improving the effectiveness and efficacy of prehabilitation programmes and potentially reducing healthcare costs. Furthermore, the robot could potentially be applied to postoperative monitoring or post-rehabilitation, suggesting its potential to further enhance the lives of elderly patients and reduce healthcare costs.
