# Walking Buddy for Prehabilitation #
Ongoing Project

## Description ##
Elderly patients who underwent physical strengthening/pre-rehabilitative exercises prior to surgery tend to have better surgical outcome and recovery rate post-surgery. This project seeks to build a wheeled robot, Walk-E, that can lead an elderly patient safely around a curated route and strengthen the patient. The robot should be able to move up to a maximum speed of 10m/s and make turns. It should also be equipped with vision capability to monitor patient's lower limb joint range-of-motion and walking performance. The determination of gait parameters such as cadence, stride length and speed, will provide the necessary feedback to regulate the robot's speed.
